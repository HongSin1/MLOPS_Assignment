        ## About this Project
        This application demonstrates our implementation of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) 
        practices for model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our team has built 2 different
        machine learning models for you to try out!
        
        ### Available Models:
        - **House Price Prediction**: Predict Melbourne property prices based on features like location, size, and amenities
        - **Wheat Kernel Classification**: Classify wheat kernels into Kama, Rosa or Canadian varieties based on geometric parameters
        
        Please use the sidebar to navigate between the different model applications! Thank you!
